My Facebook graph visualised
====================
At the MozFest 2014, I participated in a workshop by Matt Hong from Northwestern University in the USA. Matt taught the group different techniqies of graph analysis and visualision, from web tools like Wolfram Alpha to using Python to extract the data from Facebook and visualise it with a custom-developed tool originally created by @OIIOxford for its InteractiveVis project and adapted for @MozFest by @AllGoneMattHong.

I followed the tutorial on the latter and managed to create and publish (Heroku) this beautiful visualisation.

The interactive page with the graph can be found here: [Krystina Shveda's FB Network Visualisation](bitly.com/1ta7QXD) (it takes time to load!)
